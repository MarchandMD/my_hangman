# MyHangman

Welcome to my Hangman gem! 

I am learning how to build with the Ruby language, and Gems just happen to be where I currently am with my self-education. 

If this is actually a ruby gem on rubygems.org...then I actually apologize, because I don't really know what I'm doing...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'my_hangman'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install my_hangman

## Usage

If you have the repo for this project on your desktop, open up your terminal app.  

CD into the `my_hangman/lib/my_hangman/` directory  

from the terminal, you can now run `ruby run_this_file.rb`  

play to your hearts content! :)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/my_hangman.
