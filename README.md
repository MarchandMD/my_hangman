# MyHangman

This was built as a Gem, though it functions as a basic command line program.

It's the classic hangman game that choses a word from a (large-ish) dictionary.

Give it a shot!


## Play the Game - locally

easiest way is to clone this to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:MarchandMD/my_hangman.git
```

and then CD into the `my_hangman/lib/my_hangman`
From there you'll be able to:

```
ruby run_this_file.rb
```


## Play the Game - on REPL.IT

Warning: this button to "run on Repl.it" has produced mixed results...

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/MarchandMD/my_hangman)](https://repl.it/github/MarchandMD/my_hangman)

If you have the repo for this project on your desktop, open up your terminal app.

CD into the `my_hangman/lib/my_hangman/` directory

from the terminal, you can now run `ruby run_this_file.rb`

play to your hearts content! :)
