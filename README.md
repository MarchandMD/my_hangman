# MyHangman

Welcome to my Hangman gem! 

I am learning how to build with the Ruby language, and Gems just happen to be where I currently am with my self-education. 

If this is actually a ruby gem on rubygems.org...then I actually apologize, because I don't really know what I'm doing...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'my_hangman'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install my_hangman

## Usage

Warning: this button to "run on Repl.it" has produced mixed results...

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/MarchandMD/my_hangman)](https://repl.it/github/MarchandMD/my_hangman)

If you have the repo for this project on your desktop, open up your terminal app.  

CD into the `my_hangman/lib/my_hangman/` directory  

from the terminal, you can now run `ruby run_this_file.rb`  

play to your hearts content! :)

## Development

So, I built this as a Gem...but I doubt i've done all the necessary things to have it appear on rubygems.org; In fact, I've checked and it's not there.   

But if you want to re-factor or make some changes, feel free to open a PR!
