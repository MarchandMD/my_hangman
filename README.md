# MyHangman

This was built as a Gem, though it functions as a basic command line program.

It's the classic hangman game that choses a word from a (large-ish) dictionary.

Give it a shot!


## Clone it

easiest way is to clone this to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:MarchandMD/my_hangman.git
```

and then CD into the `my_hangman/lib/my_hangman`
From there you'll be able to:

```
ruby run_this_file.rb
```


## To do
- add screenshots or video
- re-factor with testing
